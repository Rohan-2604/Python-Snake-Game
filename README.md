## ‚ú® Project Description
This is a classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` graphics module. Guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or its own tail. The game features dynamic difficulty, a persistent high score, and a clean, responsive user interface.

## üöÄ Features
* **Classic Gameplay:** Intuitive controls to navigate the snake.
* **Dynamic Difficulty:** The snake's speed increases as your score goes up, providing a growing challenge.
* **Persistent High Score:** Your highest score is saved to a local file (`data.txt`), so you can always aim to beat your personal best.
* **Collision Detection:** Game over on collision with walls or self.
* **Start Screen:** A clean start screen with instructions.
* **Restart Option:** Easily restart the game after "Game Over" without closing the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Turtle Graphics Module** (Standard Library)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

    cd Python-Snake-Game
    ```
    
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    * **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
4.  **No external dependencies required!** All modules used are part of Python's standard library.
5.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
